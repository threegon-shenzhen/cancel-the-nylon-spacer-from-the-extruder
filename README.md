this is why we need to cancel the nylon spacer
Hi Jerry, Allen,

 

I think we need to review below issue 2# further.

Below picture is a calculation of the accumulated tolerance for the gear installation. 

With the current design, in theory it is a long tolerance link between the gear center to the feed hole center on the plastic bracket (The gear sit on the nylon bushing, the bushing sit on the bearing of the motor, the bearing assembled in the motor housing, the motor housing sit on the plastic bracket), although all these components are made/assembled in tight designed tolerances, the concentricity tolerance between the gear center to the feed hole center (X+D) is more than 0.8mm (about 1.0). Can you let us know your expectation tolerance for here. If the 1.0mm is far away than your expectation, we need to improve the design for shortening/broking the current long tolerance link.

 

The solution option 1#: Making the nylon bushing hole to tight fit with the motor spindle, we push/install the bushing onto the spindle with a jig, and control the tolerance between the feed hole center and the bushing’s end which the gear will sit on with the jig, that means we need to remove the condition that ‘the bushing sit against on the bearing of the motor’ from the design, that means we need to shorten the bushing and keep a safe gap between the bushing to the bearing. 

 

Solution option 2# :  cancel the nylon bushing, just use a jig to tune and align up the gear center to the feed hole center, then lock up the screw for locking the gear location on the motor spindle.

 

Let us know your advice or preference. Thanks.


Hi Maurice,
Yes, I also confirm that we will NOT use the Nylon Gear Spacer.   You will use a jig and the method we showed you by using a piece of filament to align the gear.  Also, please remember to use thread glue on the set screw that keeps the screw from coming loose.  
Many Thanks,
Jerry Grauman
